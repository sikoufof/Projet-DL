The main objective of the project is to describe the pricing policy of the company ASF (The French Road Company) on the highways (A9, A61, A62, A66, A75 and A709)
between Montpellier, Perpignan, Pamier and Toulouse.
# Preliminaries
- Selections / cleanings of collected Dataframes (sources); selections of road sections, distances between tolls, their costs, coordinates.
- Creation of Dataframes containing respectively the prices between each toll / exit and the distances between each toll / exit.
# Data visualization
- Creation of graphs, interactive histograms (plotly, Widgets) according to the highways, the tolls taken and the average cost between each entry / exit.
- Development of an algorithm allowing the calculation of the minimum cost journey from an initial point to a destination (on the highways studied) with a condition of k entry / exit.
# Assigned tasks
- Dataframe cleanings used (together)
- First Dataframe on the distances between each toll / exit (Nicolas)
- Second Dataframe on the prices of each release (Sikou)
- For the rest of the work we will do it together.
